                    When learning about interactive design in my Web Design course, I developed a tool that allows women to determine their skin type and explore different products that work well with their skin. This project highlights the use of scrollto functionality, buttons, pop-up windows, and hover states. The user can explore different skin type descriptions, find detailed information about the products displayed and their advantages, as well as links to purchase the product. The design process was intensive and multiple rounds of user testing occurred to determine whether the tool was functional and intuitive. I learned a significant amount from this project and it deepened my understanding for what it really takes to make a website interactive.
