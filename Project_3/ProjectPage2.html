                    As a part of my Business Problem Solving course, I was tasked to find and consult for a company with a complex business problem. I reached out to a Director of Strategy at Athleta and had a conversation about some challenges they had recently been encountering. A primary challenge of Athleta's was maintaining customer engagement on their mobile application. While many consumers would download the app for initial discounts, it was often found they did not return to the app in any consistent pattern. I put together a strategic solution outlining the pain points in the customer journey and highlighting potential ways to increase their engagement, purchases, and over all satisfaction.
